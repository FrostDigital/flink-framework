# Pros and cons

Flink is not for every project. It was in fact born out of a need of rapidly building small to medium sized projects.

## When is Flink a good fit?

- If you want to develop a headless service that talks HTTP.
- You enjoy TypeScript and type safety that comes with it.
- You understand importance of self documenting API's.

## When is Flink _not_ a good fit?

- You are building a webapp (an app with a web UI).
- Project is large in terms of line of code, team size.
- You want to use vanilla javascript.
- You do not want to depend on a new fast moving framework such as Flink.
