# TypeScript

Flink has been built and designed with TypeScript end-to-end.

In fact, Flink uses the TypeScript compiler to analyse source code which is an important ingredient especially when making assumptions based on types and file location of source files.

This means that you should _not_ attempt to use Flink with vanilla javascript ðŸ’¥

> Note: At the time of writing the TS compiler implementation in Flink is in alpha and subject to change, although it should not (in theory) lead to any breaking changes from developer perspective.
